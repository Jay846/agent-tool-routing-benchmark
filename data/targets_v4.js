It is best suited for large datasets where the majority class is overwhelmingly dominant and computational efficiency is a concern. Edge cases include when the minority class is extremely small, leading to severe data loss, or when the undersampling ratio is too aggressive, causing loss of generalizability.",
    "example": "In a credit card fraud detection dataset with 100,000 legitimate transactions and 500 fraudulent ones, random undersampling would randomly select 500 legitimate transactions to match the 500 fraud cases, creating a balanced training set of 1,000 samples.",

Edge case: For recurrent neural networks, use variational dropout or spatial dropout instead of standard dropout.",
    "example": "In a deep neural network with 1024 hidden units and a dropout rate of 0.3, each training iteration randomly deactivates about 307 neurons, forcing the network to learn redundant representations and improving test accuracy from 82% to 87% on a credit default prediction task.",

Lasso is ideal when you suspect many features are irrelevant and want a sparse model, but it can struggle with highly correlated features—in that case, consider Elastic Net. Edge case: if the number of features exceeds the number of samples, Lasso can select at most n samples worth of features, so use a variant like adaptive Lasso or Elastic Net.",
    "example": "A hedge fund has 50 macroeconomic indicators and wants to predict monthly S&P 500 returns. Using Lasso with alpha=0.01 on 10 years of monthly data, the model selects only 8 key indicators (e.g., unemployment rate, yield curve slope) and sets the rest to zero, improving out-of-sample Sharpe ratio by 15%.",

It is specifically for penalizing weight magnitude in gradient-based optimization, not for feature selection or sparsity (use L1 regularization for that).

Edge case: if the training metric is highly noisy or non-stationary, PBT may oscillate or overfit to transient performance spikes.",
